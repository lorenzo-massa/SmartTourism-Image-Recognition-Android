The repository consists of two parts:

* Python (Docker supported)
* Android project

The Python part is used to generate SQLite files from an image dataset and a guides folder.
The android application is ready to use and you should generate a new APK every time you compile the
python code.

You will find all the instructions you need just below.

## Monument guides creation

Go to the `Python/guides/CITYNAME` folder. Inside it there is the folder `Template Monument`
which is to be used as a template,
so without altering its structure. It is only possible to change the name of the folder with the
name of the monument which, however,
must be the same utilized in the dataset folder. Please do not remove the
folder `Template Monument`.</br>
Text, images, audios and videos can be shown
using [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Markdown

Each guide has to be given as a Markdown file. The first 7 rows of each `.md` have to be completed
as the following:

 ```
<!-- METADATA
<Latitude> <Longitude>
<Category1>, <Category2>, <Category3>
<Attribute1>, <Attribute2>, <Attribute3>, <Attribute4>, <Attribute5>
<Subtitle>
<Guide Link>
 -->
```

IMPORTANT: Files must have the same name as the files in the template folder.

### Languages

If you want to add guides in more languages, simply create additional language folders, like French,
German, and so on.
You can create separate markdown guides for each monument in different languages by providing the
relevant information for each language in the corresponding `guide.md` files. Remember to keep the
folder and file names consistent across languages. This way, you can provide guides for monuments in
multiple languages using the same structure and template.

IMPORTANT: Each monument's folder must have the guide for all the languages supported by the app. (
Template Monument included)

### Categories

Go to the `Python/categories/CITYNAME` folder and move inside it one image for each category
present in at least one monument guide.

IMPORTANT: Images must have the same name as the categories written in the monument guides. 
No images are needed for the attributes.

## Database creation

Complete the previous step before creating the database. The guides have to be completed and if you
make any modification in any guide you have to create again the database.

The repository contains the folder `Python/imageDatasets/CITYNAME` which must contains one folder per
monument and each of which contains the images, as in the following example:

```
imageDatasets/CITYNAME
├───Battistero SanGiovanni
│       img1.jpg
│       img2.jpg
│       img3.jpg
│
├───Campanile Giotto
│       img1.jpg
│       img2.jpg
│       img3.jpg
│
├───Cattedrale Duomo
│       img1.jpg
│       img2.jpg
│       img3.jpg
│
└───Palazzo Vecchio
       img1.jpg
       img2.jpg
       img3.jpg

```

Go to the folder containing the Dockerfile (i.e. the project folder) and run the following commands in a terminal:

```sh
1. docker build -t tfimage .
2. docker run -it tfimage CITYNAME
3. docker container ls -all
4. docker cp containerID:/app/models/src/main/assets/databases ./models/src/main/assets/
```
NOTE: You can find containerID in the list of the containers in the third instruction.

The following command runs the Docker to process tha visual features of the images and create the database.
The copy parameter copies also the guides and categories folders in the assets folder of the Android project.

```sh
1. ./run_docker.sh CITYNAME copy
```

otherwise run:

```sh
1. ./run_docker.sh CITYNAME
2. ./copy_guides.sh CITYNAME
```

to run first the Docker and then copy the guides and assets of the CITYNAME city (e.g. Florence, Nicosia, Athens).

If you want to update the guide without updating the visual features of the images, run:

```sh
1. ./copy_guides.sh CITYNAME
```

after updating the guides of interest, to reduce the time needed to create the database.

NOTE: 'CITYNAME' is the name of the city of the guide you are building and that you created in previous steps.
If the CITYNAME is not provided the guide for Florence will be built as default.


### APK

If you want to generate a new APK file, please refer to the following
guide: [How to Generate APK and Signed APK Files in Android Studio](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-generate-apk-and-signed-apk-files-in-android-studio--cms-37927)

You will find the APK in `app/build/outputs/apk/support/debug` .

# App User Guide

Welcome to the app! This guide will help you understand the general functioning of the application
and how to use its features effectively. Please note that this guide is written for non-expert
users, so the instructions are simplified for better understanding.

## Installation and Setup

- Install the app on your Android device from the provided APK file. You can find the APK file in
  the directory: `app/build/outputs/apk/support/debug`.
- Once installed, open the app to begin the setup process.

## Loading Screen

- When you launch the app, a loading screen will appear. This screen allows the app to load the
  necessary data into memory. Please wait until the loading process is complete.
- If it's your first time accessing the application, you will be asked to select your preferred
  categories and attributes (optional).
- For the correct functioning of the application, please accept all the asked permissions.

## Main Screen

- After the loading process, you will be directed to the main screen of the app.
- On this screen, you will see a list of monuments, grouped by categories.
- The categories displayed are based on your preferred choices. You can modify your preferred
  categories later if needed.
- The monuments are listed in order of preference, considering their attributes and interaction
  history.

## Camera and Monument Recognition

- To use the camera for monument recognition, tap on the FAB (Floating Action Button) located at the
  bottom right corner of the main screen.
- Aim your device's camera at a monument and wait for the app to recognize it.
- If the app successfully recognizes a monument, a popup will appear with additional information
  about the monument.

## Monument Guides

- When you open a guide enjoy the experience!
- Moreover, the app will recommend three monuments to visit.
- If you tap on any of the recommended monuments, the app will open the corresponding guide for that
  monument. Open the integrated map to see how to reach it!

## Preferences

You have the option to modify your preferred categories and attributes in the settings. Simply
navigate to the preferences section and make the desired changes.
Feel free to explore the settings section and customize the app to your liking.

This guide provides an overview of the app's features and functionalities. Use the app to explore
and discover various monuments. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please refer
to the app's support documentation or contact me. Enjoy your journey!
